Subject: Planned Leave Request – Confirmation & Contingency Overview

Dear Amit,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m writing to formally request approval for my planned leave from [Dates], which I submitted via [system name, if applicable] on [date].

To ensure minimal impact during this period:

Knowledge Transfer: Completed handover to Citi’s team (Rajesh’s team) and documented all processes.

UAT/Prod Readiness: Confirmed with the team that the current setup is stable for migration (no critical dependencies on my presence).

Coverage: [Colleague Name] will act as the point of contact for any platform-related queries.

Context:

I’ve extended work hours consistently to meet project milestones (including supporting parental leave/honeymoon coverage for peers).

This break is essential to recharge after 10+ months without leave, especially given the intense project phase we’ve navigated.

I’ve copied Neeraj for visibility, as he previously approved similar requests for the team. Please let me know if you’d like to discuss contingencies further.
