1. Bundle Approach Finalization
Tomorrow, we must decide whether to:

Bundle Serverless Logic within the existing Serverless/Orchestrator RHDH, or

Proceed with the standalone ISRP submission (if bundling is not approved).

Preparation:

The environment is ready for CIVA scans.

The ISDP documentation is pending Arun’s updates (see below).

2. Immediate Action Items
@Arun:

Upgrade the ISDP document per my feedback and confirm completion by [deadline, e.g., EOD today]. No further delays can be tolerated.

@Mohamed:

Secure an ISRP reviewer assignment immediately.

Confirm during tomorrow’s call:

Is there any blocker preventing reviewer assignment?

If no, provide a firm timeline for assignment.

3. Contingency Plan
If the bundling approach is rejected, we must proceed with ISRP submission as-is, given:

The environment is CIVA-ready.

The ISDP will be finalized post-Arun’s updates.

No justification remains for reviewer delay.

Let’s align tomorrow and close these gaps decisively. The timeline is at risk.
