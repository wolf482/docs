Hi Pryanka,

I noticed your question about the first column in the app_ecs_dev_users-developer and dashboard.starredDeveloperStacks permissions. To clarify:

The first column typically represents the RBAC role (e.g., developer).

The second column is usually the resource or object (e.g., dashboard.starredDeveloperStacks).

The third column defines the permission action (e.g., read).

This follows the standard Casbin format: role, resource, action. If youâ€™d like, I can share a quick example or documentation to reinforce this. Let me know how I can help!

Also, since you were just on a call with Vinneet, it might be worth syncing with him to align on any specific nuances for our implementation.
