To meet the July 8 deployment deadline for the Sonata Workflow project in 12d iLAB, we need your support to:

Push all code (selfservice plugins frontend/backend) to GitHub by [deadline, e.g., EOD 7/3] to:

Start dependency mirroring (time-sensitive due to internal processes).

Configure CI/CD workflows.

Share critical details:

GitHub repo URL (if new).

Dependency lists (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.).

Any proprietary/internal dependencies needing special handling.
