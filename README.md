Status Update:
As discussed in the RBAC meeting for the Backstage-to-Red Hat Developer Hub migration, we are working to ensure our existing RBAC permissions (defined in the rbac.csv file) are portable to Red Hat Developer Hub. Key action items:

Roles Definition in ConfigMap – As suggested by Ritesh, roles will be defined in a CSV file as part of the ConfigMap.

Permission Consolidation – Vinect noted that Pryanca will review the email and share a consolidated file with current permissions from Dev, SRW, and TenanOps for inclusion in the ConfigMap.

Awaiting the consolidated permissions file to proceed with implementation.
