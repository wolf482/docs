Hi Arun,

Following our recent discussions, I want to summarize key action items and pending decisions to ensure progress on the ISRP certification:

1. ISDP Document Updates (Your Action Required)
As discussed, you need to upgrade the ISDP document based on my feedback (shared on [date/location]). Please confirm once this is completed by [deadline, e.g., EOD today/tomorrow]. Let me know if you need clarifications on the requested changes.

2. ISRP Reviewer Assignment (Mohamed’s Action)
During tomorrow’s SME team call, we must finalize:

Decision: Whether to use login bundle or serverless/orchestrator bundle for RHDH.

Requirement: An ISRP reviewer must be assigned immediately—no further delays are acceptable.

@Mohamed: As you’re leading communication with the ISRP team, kindly confirm:

Is there any blocker preventing the reviewer assignment?

If none, by when can we expect the reviewer to be assigned?

Next Steps
Tomorrow’s Call Agenda: Resolve the bundle decision and secure reviewer assignment.

Post-Call: I’ll share minutes with clear action items and owners.

Urgency: The timeline is at risk without these items closed. Let’s avoid last-minute delays.
