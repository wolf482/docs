Subject: Action Plan for Sonata Workflow Deployment – Target July 8

Dear [Developer/Team Name],

As discussed, to ensure the environment is ready for the Sonata Workflow project deployment by July 8, we need to coordinate the following steps. Below is the action plan and dependencies required from your side:

1. Immediate Next Steps (Code Push)
Please ensure the selfservice plugins (backend/frontend) code is pushed to the GitHub remote repo by [deadline, e.g., EOD tomorrow] so we can:

Mirror dependencies.

Begin CI/CD pipeline setup for 12d iLAB.

2. Required Inputs from Your Side
To expedite the process, kindly share:

GitHub repository URL (if not already provided).

Dependency lists:

Frontend: package.json or equivalent.

Backend: requirements.txt/composer.json or build scripts.

Special requirements:

Proprietary/internal dependencies needing mirroring.

Environment variables/config files (if any).

3. CI/CD & Deployment
We’ll handle the pipeline setup but need confirmation on:

Workflow approvals: Are there manual gates (e.g., QA sign-off)?

Deployment targets: Specific 12d iLAB environments (dev/staging/prod).

Post-deployment tests: Any smoke tests to automate?

Timeline
July 3–4: Code review + dependency mirroring.

July 5–7: CI/CD testing + environment prep.

July 8: Deployment.

Action Requested:
Please confirm by [date] when the code is pushed and share any blockers. For urgent items, tag me directly.
