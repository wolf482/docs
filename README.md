Hi Arun,

As discussed in our meeting on [date], I’ve shared all relevant information regarding the RHDH Orchestrator and Serverless Logic Operator ISRP certification, including:

Detailed walkthroughs of the iLab setup for CIVA scan testing.

Comprehensive documentation and SME guidance on Orchestrator operations.

Multiple opportunities to address questions (e.g., during our meeting, I confirmed repeatedly if you needed further clarification).

To ensure we meet the project timeline, I’d like to clarify the following:

Action Items for You:

Review the provided materials and identify any specific gaps in your understanding by [deadline, e.g., Friday, July 5].

Prepare a list of concrete questions (if any) to discuss in our next sync.

Lead the [specific task, e.g., upcoming ISDP review meeting] independently, as agreed in our role alignment.

My Support:

I’m happy to address targeted questions on Orchestrator, but I’ll no longer revisit broad requests like "whole picture" without clear context.

If no gaps are flagged by [deadline], I’ll assume you’re confident to proceed with your assigned tasks. Let me know if you’d like to schedule a short call to address specific items.

Cc’d [Manager/Stakeholder]: For visibility on progress and roadblocks. Let me know if you’d like to discuss resource alignment.
