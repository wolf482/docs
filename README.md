Subject: ilab Environment Ready – Access & Backup/Restore Instructions

Hi [Developer Lead's Name],

The ilab environment is now available for your team. To ensure smooth collaboration and access control, I’d appreciate your help in identifying who will be working in this space. Here’s what you need to know:

1. Environment Access & Collaboration
Current Access: You (as the lead) have admin-level access to the ilab project in OpenShift.

Additional Collaborators: Could you confirm which developers will need access? Please share their:

Names

OpenShift usernames (or emails, if SSO-based)

Required permissions (e.g., edit, view, admin)

Once confirmed, I’ll ensure permissions are assigned promptly.

2. Backup & Restore (Self-Service)
To safeguard against accidental changes, here’s how to back up and restore resources (Routes, ConfigMaps, Secrets, etc.):

Backup All Resources
bash
mkdir ilab-backup && cd ilab-backup  
oc get all,cm,secret,route,svc,deployments -n ilab -o yaml > ilab-backup.yaml  
For granular backups (e.g., separate files per resource type):

bash
oc get -n ilab -o=yaml all > all-resources.yaml  
oc get -n ilab -o=yaml cm > configmaps.yaml  
oc get -n ilab -o=yaml secret > secrets.yaml  
# ... repeat for other types (route, svc, etc.)  
Restore from Backup
bash
oc apply -f ilab-backup.yaml -n ilab  
# OR (if using separate files):  
oc apply -f . -n ilab  
3. Platform Updates & Communication
We’ll notify you in advance of any platform-level changes (e.g., OpenShift upgrades).

For critical updates, we can coordinate backups/restores together.

Next Steps:

Reply with your team’s access needs.

Let me know if you’d like a quick demo of backup/restore or permission management.

This way, we can balance autonomy for your team with stability for the environment.
